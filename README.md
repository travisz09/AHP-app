## Analytical Hierarchy Process app for Multi Criterion Decision Making

Calculate weights matrix for multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP).

Input two or more component variables influencing your decision making. Adjust the pair wise comparison sliders in the direction of the more important variable, using Saaty's absolute numbers as a reference. Based on user input a balanced weights matrix will be generated, quantifying the absolute importance of all component variables. These weights can be incorporated into a mathematical formula for decision making, especially for GIS based suitability analysis, or other matrix-based equations.
